            <h2>Oscar Bartra</h2>
            <p>Elrey and I met in Philadelphia on October 6, 2012 when I was celebrating my birthday with some friends at a
              club. He went with a friend of his. Elrey didn’t really want to go out that night, but fortunately Gil dragged
              him out. We liked each other and began dating shortly after and well we are married now so things went well!</p>

            <h2>Elrey Belmonti</h2>
            <p>
              My continuing mission: to explore the world with Oscar, to seek out new ways to make Oscar happy. To remember things when
              Oscar forgets. To cook good food for Oscar. To pay all kiss taxes whenever they are due. To learn Spanish so
              I can talk to Oscar’s family. To not be too cranky in the morning when Oscar is wide awake. To love Oscar more
              than anything in this world.
